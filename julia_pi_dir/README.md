# Julia implementation

This folder contains three implementations:

* `pi.jl` - parallel implementation
* `pi_serial.jl` - serial implementation
* `pi_cheat.jl` - implementation which does a dummy call to the function doing the work before the main call to trick Julia into compiling it ahead of time.
